No matter what, you're going to mess up sometimes, it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you're going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.”\", 'Marilyn Monroe'], ['“I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up where I needed to be.”', 'Douglas Adams'], ['“Good friends, good books, and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life.”', 'Mark Twain'], ['“Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans.”', 'Allen Saunders'], ['“Today you are You, that is truer than true.
